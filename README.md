Simple Linear Regression in Machine Learning
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of Simple Linear Regression, one of the most basic and widely used supervised learning algorithms in machine learning.
The goal is to establish a relationship between an independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y) by fitting the best possible straight line.

🔑 Key Concepts

Simple Linear Regression: A statistical method that models the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable using a linear equation.

Equation of Line:

𝑌
=
𝑚
𝑋
+
𝑐
Y=mX+c

where:

Y → Dependent variable (target)

X → Independent variable (feature)

m → Slope of the line

c → Intercept

Objective: Minimize the error (difference) between predicted values and actual values using techniques like Least Squares Method.

⚙️ Implementation Steps

Import Libraries: Use Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn.

Load Dataset: Load a sample dataset (e.g., salary vs experience, study hours vs scores).

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, split dataset into training and testing sets.

Train the Model: Use LinearRegression() from scikit-learn to fit the data.

Predict Results: Generate predictions on test data.

Evaluate the Model: Check metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² score, etc.

Visualization: Plot regression line with training/testing data points.


📊 Example Output

🚀 Applications

Predicting sales based on advertising budget.

Estimating salary based on years of experience.

Forecasting scores based on study hours.

Any domain where a linear relationship exists between two variables.

✅ Requirements

Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-Learn



Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental machine learning technique that helps in understanding relationships between two variables. Though simple, it forms the basis for more complex regression and predictive modeling techniques.
